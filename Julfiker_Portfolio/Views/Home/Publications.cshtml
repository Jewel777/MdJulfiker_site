                <strong>Abstract:</strong> Recently, the advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) 
                which integrate text with other modalities such as images, audio, and video, promise to 
                revolutionize various fields ranging from natural language processing to computer vision and 
                beyond. However, while MLLMs have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, 
                their inner workings remain largely opaque, presenting significant challenges in terms of 
                interpretability, robustness, and ethical considerations. This paper investigates the next 
                frontier in artificial intelligence research: understanding multimodal large language models. 
                We explore the architecture and applications of MLLMs, shedding light on their capabilities 
                and limitations. By delving into the intricacies of multimodal large language models, this 
                paper aims to show the potential use of LLM in biomedical and advanced machine learning 
                algorithms to extract valuable features and improve the prediction accuracy of clinical 
                analysis. Therefore, it will pave the way for future research directions and facilitate the 
                development of more transparent, equitable, and trustworthy AI systems.

                    <strong>Abstract‚Äî</strong> Accurate methods predicting flow in a river require high performance computing systems providing only short-term early warnings. To address these limitations, we propose an optimized Long Short Term Memory layer combined with a Fully connected layer within a six-layer architecture to estimate flows based on readings of three neighboring river gage heights. This study assessed the number of cells in the LSTM and the number of neurons in the Fully connected layer as well as the probability in the Dropout layer to avoid overfitting. Identification of the best settings by means of the RMSE evaluated six different input datasets to estimate flow. Our study proved that relying on the river gage height from neighboring sensors is possible to predict flow which is crucial when a sensor may fail and a reliable neural network at low computational cost can handle that.

                    <strong>Abstract‚Äî</strong> Upper limb amputation can severely restrict the mobility and ability of amputees to perform daily activities. In addressing this issue, deep learning algorithms and electromyography pattern recognition have emerged as promising clinical solutions for functional upper-limb prosthetics. This article presents the use of EMG sensors to capture muscle movement signals and applies the pattern recognition function of a 1D convolutional neural network to identify these signals and control the movement of prosthetics. Experimental results demonstrate that the convolutional neural network exhibits fast training and high-precision recognition capabilities enabling it to accurately identify muscle signals and effectively control prosthetic movements.

                    <strong>Abstract‚Äî</strong>In recent years, phishing attacks have become widespread cyber threats affecting people, governments, private sectors, service providers, and internet users globally. Attackers collect personal information about the targeted victims through emails or fake websites, such as user account login details, bank card numbers, etc. The victim is manipulated using a combination of technical and social engineering techniques. This paper provides a review of recent existing research on various phishing attacks, including HTTPS phishing, spear phishing, whale phishing, pop-up phishing, and email spoofing hacking. It also explores how to identify such attacks using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Additionally, the paper investigates the benefits and drawbacks of different defense approaches and provides an overview of the challenges related to phishing attack detection.
