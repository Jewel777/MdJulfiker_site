                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Recently, the advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
                        which integrate text with other modalities such as images, audio, and video, promise to
                        revolutionize various fields ranging from natural language processing to computer vision and
                        beyond. However, while MLLMs have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
                        their inner workings remain largely opaque, presenting significant challenges in terms of
                        interpretability, robustness, and ethical considerations. This paper investigates the next
                        frontier in artificial intelligence research: understanding multimodal large language models.
                        We explore the architecture and applications of MLLMs, shedding light on their capabilities and
                        limitations. By delving into the intricacies of multimodal large language models, this paper
                        aims to show the potential use of LLM in biomedical and advanced machine learning algorithms to
                        extract valuable features and improve the prediction accuracy of clinical analysis. Therefore,
                        it will pave the way for future research directions and facilitate the development of more
                        transparent, equitable, and trustworthy AI systems.

                        <strong>Abstract—</strong> Accurate methods predicting flow in a river require high performance
                        computing systems providing only short-term early warnings. To address these limitations, we
                        propose an optimized Long Short Term Memory layer combined with a Fully connected layer within a
                        six-layer architecture to estimate flows based on readings of three neighboring river gage
                        heights. This study assessed the number of cells in the LSTM and the number of neurons in the
                        Fully connected layer as well as the probability in the Dropout layer to avoid overfitting.
                        Identification of the best settings by means of the RMSE evaluated six different input datasets
                        to estimate flow. Our study proved that relying on the river gage height from neighboring
                        sensors is possible to predict flow which is crucial when a sensor may fail and a reliable
                        neural network at low computational cost can handle that.

                        <strong>Abstract—</strong> Upper limb amputation can severely restrict the mobility and ability
                        of amputees to perform daily activities. In addressing this issue, deep learning algorithms and
                        electromyography pattern recognition have emerged as promising clinical solutions for functional
                        upper-limb prosthetics. This article presents the use of EMG sensors to capture muscle movement
                        signals and applies the pattern recognition function of a 1D convolutional neural network to
                        identify these signals and control the movement of prosthetics. Experimental results demonstrate
                        that the convolutional neural network exhibits fast training and high-precision recognition
                        capabilities enabling it to accurately identify muscle signals and effectively control prosthetic
                        movements.

                        <strong>Abstract—</strong> In recent years, phishing attacks have become widespread cyber
                        threats affecting people, governments, private sectors, service providers, and internet users
                        globally. Attackers collect personal information about the targeted victims through emails or
                        fake websites, such as user account login details, bank card numbers, etc. The victim is
                        manipulated using a combination of technical and social engineering techniques. This paper
                        provides a review of recent existing research on various phishing attacks, including HTTPS
                        phishing, spear phishing, whale phishing, pop-up phishing, and email spoofing hacking. It also
                        explores how to identify such attacks using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including
                        Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Additionally, the paper investigates the benefits and
                        drawbacks of different defense approaches and provides an overview of the challenges related to
                        phishing attack detection.

                        critical infrastructure that sustains our daily lives has become increasingly reliant on complex
                        digital systems like Internet of Things (IoT). While these complex digital systems have brought
                        convenience and efficiency to critical infrastructure, they have also become prime targets for
                        malicious parties seeking to exploit vulnerabilities, raising concerns across vital sectors like
                        energy, healthcare, transportation, and beyond. Through systematic literature review, historical
                        incident analysis, and examination of recent attacks, this paper aims to deepen our understanding
                        of the evolving threat landscape, emphasizing the urgency of strengthening defenses, particularly
                        in the IoT realm to secure the foundations of modern society. This literature survey encompasses
